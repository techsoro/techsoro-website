In the internet era, every organization is storing large data and it is difficult to maintain this much data. There are different databases available but it is very difficult to select the best suitable for our requirement. Mainly databases are classified into Relational database and Non-relational database. 


**Relational database:** It is also called SQL(Structured Query Language) database and it is a set of data organized by tables, records and columns.

Ex: MySQL, MariaDB, and Postgres etc.

**Non-relational database:** It is also called NoSQL(Non Structured Query Language) database. In NoSQL databases data is stored in documents and collections. What NoSQL databases gain in speed, flexibility, availability and partition tolerance, they lack in data consistency and most NoSQL stores can not handle [ACID transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)).

Ex: MongoDB, Cassandra, and HBase.

Though there are many database options available today, Relational database is still best choice. New SQL and NoSQL have their place, but a relational database is still the solid choice.

### Why Relational database is still best choice?

**Ease of Use:** The use of tables to store data in columns and rows makes it easy to access and manage data.

**Data Security:** With an RDBMS you can hide sensitive tables and give them their authorization codes, providing a layer of protection for your data

**SQL Standard:** SQL is a standardized language well understood by many applications, and many of the alternative database options provide SQL interfaces.

**Data Integrity:** the structure of the relational database preserves the integrity of the data and makes it easier to meet compliance regulations.

**Performance:**  An RDBMS uses indexes to sort data and speed up performance, and supports both desktop and web applications.

**Development and  Support:** The large players — Oracle, Microsoft, SAP — have a vested interest in continuing to develop and evolve their database offering to meet modern standards.

**RDBMS Standards:**  Relational databases adhere to ACID properties to ensure the reliability of transactions.
